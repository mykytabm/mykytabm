### C#/C++ software engineer based in the Hague, the Netherlands.

I’ve got a degree in software engineering with a specialization in game engineering from Saxion University of Applied Sciences. 

A problem-solver by nature, I have an eye for solving problems and finding original solutions. Very passionate about ideas and projects, constantly working on something fun in my free time, you can check out my projects here. You can also read about my experience in detail in my [CV](https://www.nikitabm.xyz/s/CV-2022-MB.pdf).

I am a big fan of chess, competitive computer games, stylish movies, fantasy books, and great music. I think it is important to have interests outside your main field of expertise, though I am reading about IT, new technologies, techniques, or just thoughts on software development every day (haha) and for me, it’s as much fun as my other interests.
